## 🧩 How It Works

1. The app starts with a **single-column** RecyclerView layout.  
2. When the **Switch** is toggled, it dynamically updates the layout manager to **GridLayoutManager(2)** for a two-column view.  
3. Each item in the RecyclerView displays:
   - 🖼️ An image  
   - 📝 A title  
   - 💬 A subtitle
